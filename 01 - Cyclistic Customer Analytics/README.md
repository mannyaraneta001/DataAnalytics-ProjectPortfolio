# ABOUT PROJECT 1

In this project, I analyzed a dataset with over 5.8 million observations to gain a better understanding of how casual riders differed from annual members of a local bike share company in terms of differnt measures of consumer behavior.

The goal of this project is to analyze the company's historical bike trip data to identify trends that can help in advancing the objectives of the marketing analytics team.

Scope of the Dataset: May 2022 - April 2023.
