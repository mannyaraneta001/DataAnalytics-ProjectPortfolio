# ABOUT PROJECT 3

Based on the data retrieved from Project 2, I created an interactive inventory dashboard that will allow users to easily assess how each of the 80 stores performed 
during the year. Additionally, performance indicators that can help management in evaluating supplier relations, store performance, and overall approach to inventory management
were identified. The dashboard for this project was created using Tableau.
